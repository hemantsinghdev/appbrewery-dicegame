# ðŸŽ² Dice Game â€” App Brewery Project

This is a beginner JavaScript game built while following the

**[Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-yu/)** on Udemy.

The game simulates a two-player dice roll. On each page load:
- Two dice are rolled using `Math.random()`
- The result is displayed with corresponding dice images
